## A Personal Site That Won't Disappear

**Hydejack** is 100% built on Open Source software, and is Open Source itself, save for parts of the PRO version. The PRO version is a one-time payment that gives you the right to use it forever.

Hydejack is all static sites. _HTML_. All you need is a web server — any web server — to have a professional web presence that lasts a lifetime.
